design notes

want a console interpreter which interacts with some kind of Runner class, which takes the various options as interpreted by commandline and returns, via callback methods, various data

then runner asks a simulation factory for a simulator and runs that. simulators are going to probably be some kind of abstract class hierarchy so i can easily drop in
different heuristics like simulated annealing, etc.
